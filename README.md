# README.me Generator
  
  
  

  ## Description
  I created a README.me generator using node.js. I wrote functions to be able to have questions prompted and a user is able to answer and create a README. I also made my README for this page using my generator.

  ## Installation
  The user must enter node index.js in the command line to run the application. They then must answer each question that is required. A README file is then generated.
  ## Usage
  A README generator is useful for porjects because the template it laid out and makes writing a README much quicker and easier.
